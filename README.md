The code I was given was all of the code outside of the psuedocode. The code I had to make was bsed off the provided psuedocode.
Using the 24/7 SNHU support I had them assist me in making the code based on the provided instructions. The process was very similar to the previous project
the only difference was the methodology and how the computer learned. The difference in how computers learn greatly impact the success rate and the time
it takes for the computer to accomplish the goal. Each learning methedology has it's own strengths and weaknesses which impact what you should use. 

Computer scientists focus on many different things and accomplish many different objectives. Some are purely focused on machine learning, some are focused 
and data analysis, and others might keep servers running. However they always are trying to give someone the best experience possible. Data analysis 
is important for consumers and so is machine learning. Every computer scientist is trying to accomplish the task at hand in the best way possible.
To approach a problem as a computer scientist you need to understand the problem and what is expected as a result, look at current solutions,
design a good approach to the problem, and create and modify the design while testing it. These steps are needed for approaching a problem 
as a computer scientist. With ethical responsibilities you have to protect privacy, be transparent, ensure accessibility, meet security guidelines,
and have a reliable product. You must also always follow rules and regulations to ensure you meet the requirements your consumers expect.
